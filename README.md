# GymMembershipDataAnalysis

I wanted to use my SQL skills and learn more about creating dashboards using Tableau with this project.

I extracted data from Kaggle.com. The dataset I used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ka66ledata/gym-membership-dataset.

Then, I transformed in using MySQL using SQL queries. 
The queries I used were:
  CREATE DATABASE
  USE
  SELECT *
  ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN
  ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN (column renaming)
  DESCRIBE
  WHERE ... IS NULL (null-checking)
  COUNT(*)
  COUNT(DISTINCT) (implied or could enhance KPIs)
  AVG(...)
  SUM(...)
  CASE WHEN ... THEN ... END (used for age grouping)
  GROUP BY
  ORDER BY
  WHERE BETWEEN ... AND ... (inside CASE for age ranges)

After I completed transofmring my data, I loaded it into Tableau where I created a dashboard highlighting the findings from my analysis. A photo of my dashboard can be found in my repository. The link to my dashboard is : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/caroline.klug/viz/shared/7NT2PRMXB
